# Airline Reservation System (Java)

A project that needs to be developed using the Java language. This project must be completed to get marks in the subject of Object Oriented Programming.

The flow of this project is the same as the Airline Reservation System project using C++(in repository), but this time it is more neatly structured using Java.
